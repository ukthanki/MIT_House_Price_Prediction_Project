Up to this point in the course, we had covered the following topics:
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. SQL

The purpose of this project is to analyze housing data in order to build a predictive model that can be used to determine the house price of a house with certain characteristics. The general process that was followed was introduced earlier in the course; this exploration allows for the possiblity of new approaches to the problem to make a better model.
